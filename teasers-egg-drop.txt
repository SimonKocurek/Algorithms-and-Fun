100 floors
2 eggs

Find floor at which eggs won't break.
-------------------------------------

1) With 1 egg it's at worst 100 attempts.
2) With 2 the situation changes .. we can
   apply binary search which would bring us
   to a 50 attempts at worst.
3) We can improve this. If a thrown egg won't
   break we can use it again. So using parts
   smaller than 1/2 can be faster.
4) After testing it's clear that sqrt(100) is
   the number of steps we take with the first
   egg and only after it breaks, we change the
   step to 1.
5) Why sqrt(100)? The more floors the first egg
   skips, the more the second one has to test ..
   so choosing a value where both are same is
   minimal in the worst case.
