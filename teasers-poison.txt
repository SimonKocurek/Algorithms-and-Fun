1000 bottles.
1 is poisoned.

10 test strips.
Reusable and works on any number of drops.

Tests only once a day.
7 days to get test result.
--------------------------------

1) Similar to BIT, we let each test strip reperesent if tested bottle id
   has certain bit on.
2) Now looking at the positive tests we can tell what bits are on in the
   poissoned bottle id.
