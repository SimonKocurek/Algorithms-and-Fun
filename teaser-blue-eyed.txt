Blue-eyed must leave as soon as possible.
1 flight each day.
They can only see others.
There is at least 1 blue eyed.
------------------------------

1) Start at 1, because there is at least 1.
2) 1 would leave if he didn't see any other blue-eyed.
2) 2 would leave after 2 days .. because both can see just 1 blue-eyed
   person not leaving on day 1.
3) 3 would leave after 3 days .. because all of then would see 2 blue-eyed
   people that didn't leave 2 days.
4) Repeat... solution is number of blue-eyed people.
