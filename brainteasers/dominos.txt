8x8 board with missing 2 opposite corners.
31 dominoes where each takes 2 spaces on board.
Is there a possible placement?
---------------------------------------------

There isn't. First row and column have only 7 spaces.
By using vertival placement we would only achieve 
5x8 board and same problem... 3x8, 1x8 where corner
is missing, so we can't do that. By using horizontal
we need to use at least one vertical placement, again
creating odd number of places in different row/ column.
