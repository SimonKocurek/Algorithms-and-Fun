Ants on 3 vertexes of triangle.
Each picks random direction.
What is probability of collision on triangle and N-gon?
-------------------------

1) All possibilities 2^n (each can choose one of 2 directions).
2) Good possibilities 2^n - 2 (all without cases where all ants
   choose same direction).
3) Result is (2^n) / (2^n - 2).
